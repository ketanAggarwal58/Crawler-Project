# Interview-project

This is a project Created for interview screening round of Datazeit.io

## About This Project:

This is a project in which we have to build a Web Crawler which will crawler the flaconi.de and scrap the data from the product page.

The Data which will be scrapped are listed down below:
- Product Brand
- Product Title
- Product Image URL

The tech Stack which i used are listed Down below:
- React JS with AntD and Ant Viz
- PostgreSQL as the Database
- Nodejs (for the Backend System)
- Docker

## My Approach:

In the Crawler I used the Chrome's Inspect tool and in that i used Query Selecter to select the particular query which is then used to scrap the data from the web page.

I Used PostgreSQL as the queue and heavly focused on the Job_status field as it contains the status of the application.
